# Better Blockgame

This is a resource pack made for blockgame, a minecraft server owned by PirateSoftware. This pack is not official in any way - just meant so you have a better time playing blockgame!

Thanks so much to Notker who previously wrote a pack for blockgame, which I learned from to make this pack. The textures in this pack are from a wide range of sources, with there being those which I drew, those which I modified from some of the sources below, and those which came directly from the sources below! Thank you to Tylerrrr and the FurfSky team for the source of many of the textures - you can find their pack for Hypixel Skyblock at furfsky.net and their discord at https://discord.com/invite/fsr

# How to use

To use this resource pack, you need to install Chime:
https://modrinth.com/mod/chime

After installing chime, download the resource pack in the releases tab on the right and drag it into your resource pack folder
